					<h3>About Dr. Megan Ross</h3>
					<h4>Personal Profile</h4>
					<p>
						Megan was called to the bar in Alberta in 2010, with the Honourable Justice Papperny of the Alberta Court of Appeal presiding over the ceremony. Justice Papperny's inspiring words have resonated with Megan throughout her career. She emphasized the challenges women face in the legal industry, urging that the profession would not improve until women began to remain in it and work toward changing it. This message was pivotal in inspiring the founding of Ross Estate Law. A boutique firm that aims to provide world class representation to everyday clients with reasonable flat fees and exceptional client service.
					</p>
					<p>
						Megan's expertise in estate law was cultivated under the mentorship of the late Honourable Dr. Palmer of Burnet, Duckworth & Palmer LLP. Known for his distinguished style and timeless wisdom, Mr. Palmer imparted invaluable knowledge to Megan in the areas of estate planning, administration, probate and exceptional client care.
					</p>
					<p>
						With a diverse professional background, Megan has experience in both large firms and boutique settings. She has also served as a professor of law and legal theory, bringing a well-rounded perspective to her practice. Her expertise extends to corporate, tax, and human rights law, making her uniquely equipped to address the complexities of estate matters with a comprehensive approach.
					</p>
					<p>
						Megan has a law degree from the University of Calgary, a Master's in Laws (LLM) from New York University and a Doctorate in Law (SJD) from the University of Toronto.
					</p>
					<p>
						When Megan isn't working, you'll find her either on the beach with her two dogs, Steve and Dave, in the garden or baking away.
