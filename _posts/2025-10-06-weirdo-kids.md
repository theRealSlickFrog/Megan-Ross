The photo was taken on what was supposed to be a quick five-minute trip to the hardware store. Five minutes, that’s all it was meant to be. But somewhere between backing out of the driveway and finding a parking spot, the universe decided otherwise.

The dad, ever the optimist, insisted on a “quick selfie to document the adventure.” The kids, less enthusiastic, knew from experience that any outing involving their father, a coupon, and a vague shopping list could last until nightfall. The one in the passenger seat had already resigned himself to fate, headphones ready for emotional support. The one in the back seat was still hopeful—smiling politely, unaware that by the third aisle they’d be asked to help choose between seventeen slightly different shades of beige paint.

They never did make it to the hardware store. Somewhere along the way, Dad remembered a “really good deal” at the electronics place, and then there was the coffee stop that turned into a philosophical debate about whether donuts count as breakfast or dessert. By the time they returned home, the only thing they’d bought was a keychain shaped like a hammer and a mysterious bag of mulch that no one remembered picking up.

But the selfie remained—proof of their bravery and survival. In the family album, it’s now titled *“The Great Five-Minute Trip That Lasted Forever.”* The kids still refuse to get in the car without snacks, and Dad still insists, “This time, it really will be quick.”
